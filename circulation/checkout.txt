== Checking out materials

To check out materials, you must first open a member's account.

include::retrieving.txt[]

TIP: Anybody with administrator privileges can turn member barcodes on using Tools -> System Settings -> Use Member Barcodes.

=== Checking out an item

. Type or scan the item barcode into the Check Out field.
. Any items you have checked out will appear on the screen, provided there are no errors in the patron or copy records.
. If there are errors (often a mis-scanned barcode), they will appear at the bottom of the screen.
