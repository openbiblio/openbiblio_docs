== Creating a new member

. Click on Members, under the circulation menu.
. Click "Add new member".
. Enter the desired information.
. Some people may use a name other than their legal name.  If this is the case,
enter the name they prefer in the "First name" and "Last name" fields, and if
it is necessary, enter their legal name into the "Legal first name" and/or
"Legal last name" fields.  This will allow your library to retrieve information
about this member using both versions of their name.
