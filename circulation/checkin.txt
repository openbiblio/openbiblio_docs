== Checking in materials

. Click on Circulation on the left side of the screen.
. Click Check In.
. Type or scan the barcode number.
. If the book was checked out, it will be added to the shelving cart, which is represented by a list at the bottom of the screen.

NOTE: Check in only works on items that are checked out.
It will not remove other statuses, such as "lost".

After you check in your materials, you will probably want to
empty the shelving cart as well.

Does the screen display fines if the item being checked in
is overdue?
