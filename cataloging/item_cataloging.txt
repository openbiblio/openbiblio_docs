=== Adding an item

After you add your record, you will be able to attach an actual, physical item to it.

If your library is using barcodes, you will be able to scan or type your barcode into the
barcode number field.  If you have the Auto Barcode option selected, OpenBiblio will
generate a barcode for you.  If you are not using barcodes, OpenBiblio will generate
one that will only be used for internal purposes.

If item Photos are enabled, the user will be given to capture an image of the item (usually the dust cover).
This feature requires a webcam or equiv. Enabling this feature will also cause the user to be ocassionally 'bugged'
to formally allow the browser to take photos - this is a HTML5 'feature' designed to ensure user privacy.
Once photos are available, they will show up on various reports, biblio lists, etc.
