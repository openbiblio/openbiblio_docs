=== Adding an item

After you add your record, you will be able to attach an actual, physical item to it.

If your library is using barcodes, you will be able to scan or type your barcode into the
barcode number field.  If you have the Auto Barcode option selected, OpenBiblio will
generate a barcode for you.  If you are not using barcodes, OpenBiblio will generate
one that will only be used for internal purposes.
