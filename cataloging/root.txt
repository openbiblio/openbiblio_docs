= Cataloging

OpenBiblio offers several ways to get your materials into your catalog.

== Copy cataloging

. Click Cataloging.
. Click New Item.
. Type or scan an ISBN. If you are unable to find any results using an ISBN, you can use the dropdown menus to try other search criteria.
. If it finds a catalog record from a different library, it will fill in all the fields that it can, based on the media type and information from the other library.
. Make sure that the call number is correct.

[Note]
If you are seeing the wrong type of call number (e.g. you see a LoC call number when your library uses Dewey Decimal),
somebody with admin privileges will need to change the Admin -> Online Options settings.

. Click Submit.
. Enter copy information as needed. Click Update.

== Importing MARC records

By default, the MARC record importer imports items as a "test load,"
so you can verify that there are no errors.  You can set "test load"
to false once you are satisfied with your settings and file.

== Importing CSV records

Instructions coming soon.


== Bulk delete records
