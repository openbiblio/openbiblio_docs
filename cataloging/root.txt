= Cataloging

OpenBiblio offers several ways to get your materials into your catalog and to manage the records you have entered.

== Orientation to OpenBiblio cataloging

OpenBiblio uses the MARC format as the basis for the catalog, but its editing interfaces display human-readable field labels,
rather than specific numeric MARC tags.

OpenBiblio's use of MARC is pretty standard, but there are a few specific ways it treats certain fields.

=== Call numbers

OpenBiblio's Call Number searches search only 099$a, which is the local call number field.  However, if you'd like to add call numbers from other fields, you can enable the Call Number Utilities plugin, which allows you to populate the 099$a fields with data from other
call number fields to make them searchable.


=== Special subfields

Three subfields display somewhat differently than usual.

* Field 024 $a (identifier) is assumed to be a DOI, so it displays as a link to that digital object.
* Field 505 $a (contents) is typically very long, so it displays as a scrollable text field.
* Field 856 $u (URL - included by default in the ebook and web site material types) displays as a hyperlink.


== Copy cataloging

. Click Cataloging.
. Click New Item.
. Type or scan an ISBN. If you are unable to find any results using an ISBN, you can use the dropdown menus to try other search criteria.
. If it finds a catalog record from a different library, it will fill in all the fields that it can, based on the media type and information from the other library.
. Make sure that the call number is correct.

[Note]
If you are seeing the wrong type of call number (e.g. you see a LoC call number when your library uses Dewey Decimal),
somebody with admin privileges will need to change the Admin -> Online Options settings.

. Click Submit.
. Enter copy information as needed. Click Update.

== Importing MARC records

By default, the MARC record importer imports items as a "test load,"
so you can verify that there are no errors.  You can set "test load"
to false once you are satisfied with your settings and file.

NOTE: MARC records can use any one of a number of different encoding schemes.  Before you import any MARC records, be sure that your administrator has selected the correct
character set in Admin -> Character Set.

== Importing CSV records

=== The CSV File 
CSV files are laid out in columns and rows. The first row must contain the heading information. 

Some common headings are:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
Column header,Meaning
barCo,Barcode Number
media,Media Type
coll,Collection
099$a,Call Number
100$a,Author
245$a,Title
245$h,Medium
306$a,Playing Time
260$c,"Date of Publication, Distribution, etc."
|===

To find more headings click on the "Admin" link on the left side of the page. From there click on the link that says "Biblio Fields". There you will find different options to use for headers.
The data will go from the second row down in the CSV file. The data needs to be input in the same order as the column headings in the first row.
The Media Type heading requires specific data to be input in the column. The data options available for the media column are:

* audio tapes
* book
* cd audio
* cd computer
* equipment
* magazines
* maps
* video/dvd

=== Importing the CSV file

Click on the "Browse" button, from there you should be prompted to open your CSV file.
In the options box you will need to find the "Show all records" drop down. This drop down needs to be set as yes or you will be unable to view the records.
