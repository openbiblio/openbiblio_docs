= Reports

OpenBiblio has a very flexible report system.

== Running a report

. Click on Reports.
. Find the report you'd like to run and click on it.
. OpenBiblio will ask you to add any additional
necessary specifications.
. You may sort the report by clicking on the headings.

=== Exporting to different formats

You may export your report results in PDF, CSV, or MARC
formats.  If you'd like to print the results, we recommend
the PDF format (found after you run a report under Reports ->
Report Results -> Print List).

== Adding new reports

You need access to the server via FTP, RDP, or SSH.
