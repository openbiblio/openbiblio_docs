# openbiblio_docs
Welcome to the documentation for [OpenBiblio 1.x](https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-1.0-wip).  We would really appreciate your
contribution and collaboration.

# Contributing basics

The files here document the [obiblio-1.0-wip repository](https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-1.0-wip/src) as it currently stands, and will aim to keep up with bugfixes and new features as they are added.

The folders you see in this documentation repository each represent a different book of end-user documentation.  Here is a list of what folders produce which documentation:

Source in this folder| Public HTML version|Public PDF version

The `txt` files are written in ASCIIDOC, which the Evergreen community has [kindly documented](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/pub?id=17KpO9tMYBObec3coijFAxFDjDCrOIfoVDMa3Q1k8_lE).

Each folder contains a file called `root.txt`, which uses ASCIIDOC `include::my_file_name.txt[]` statements to gather all the individual pieces of documentation that it needs.  The [massive complete book](http://openbiblio.github.io/openbiblio_docs/root.pdf) is generated by a `root.txt` file in the root of this directory.

The script `compile_all.sh` actually creates all the PDF and HTML files.  If you've got a Linux box, feel free to run it after you make changes to the `.txt` files.  Otherwise, don't sweat it; I'll compile your changes next time I make a change to the docs.

GitHub automatically publishes the docs because we are using the `gh-pages` branch.

You will also probably wish to consult the codebase to figure out exact behavior.  You can find the code here: https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-1.0-wip/src

# Contributing through GitHub Desktop 
1. Download the Github Desktop at https://desktop.github.com/.
2. [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop/).
3. Choose a folder on your local computer where you'd like to house these files.
4. Navigate to this folder using Windows Explorer.
5. Edit the files using any text editor you'd like.  If you are making a simple edit, simply find the correct `.txt` file and make your correction.
6. If you are adding a lot of new content, create a new `.txt` file in the appropriate folder.  Put an `include::my_new_file.txt[]` in the folder's `root.txt` file.
7. Navigate back to GitHub Desktop and go to the Changes tab.  You should see a listing of all of the modifications you made.
8. Type a summary of your change and click "Commit to gh-pages".

# Contributing through GitHub's Web interface

1. If you don't have edit permissions on this directory, click "Fork" to make your own working copy of the repo.
2. If you are making a simple edit, simply find the correct `.txt` file and make your correction.
3. If you are adding a lot of new content, create a new `.txt` file in the appropriate folder.  Put an `include::my_new_file.txt[]` in the folder's `root.txt` file.
4. If you are documenting a completely new module and wish to create a new folder, click "create file" and name the file `module_name` + forward slash + `root.txt`.  For example, if you wanted to document a space exploration module, you would create a file called `space_exploration/root.txt`.
4. Save your edits.
5. If you don't have edit permissions, submit a pull request to get your changes incorporated.  This sounds complicated, but it's
actually pretty simple:
  * Go to your forked repository.
  * Click the pull requests tab
  * Click New Pull Request.
  * Verify your changes, then click "Create pull request".

# Contributing on the command line.
