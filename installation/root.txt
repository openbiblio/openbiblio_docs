= Installing OpenBiblio

== System requirements

We have tested OpenBiblio installation on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux 14.04.

We also plan to test other versions of Windows, Ubuntu Linux 12.04, Debian Linux, Fedora Linux, Mac OSX, and CentOS Linux.

To install OpenBiblio, you will need PHP version 5.4 or higher.  We have not yet tested OpenBiblio on PHP 6.x or 7.x.

You will need MySQL.  Not sure of version.

You will also need Apache.
