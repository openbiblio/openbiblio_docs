= Installing OpenBiblio

== System requirements

We have tested OpenBiblio installation on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux 14.04.

We also plan to test other versions of Windows, Ubuntu Linux 12.04, Debian Linux, Fedora Linux, Mac OSX, and CentOS Linux.

To install OpenBiblio, you will need PHP version 5.4 or higher.
We are actively revising the codebase to make OpenBiblio
fully compatible with PHP 7.  You are welcome to use OpenBiblio
with PHP 7, but be aware that you may see 
warning messages.

You will need MySQL.  Not sure of version.

You will also need some Web server program.  OpenBiblio has been tested 
with both Apache and nginx.
