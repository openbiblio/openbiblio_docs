== Installing OpenBiblio 1.0 on a Linux host with full access

These instructions consist mainly of commands that you can run in your terminal to quickly get a working installation of OpenBiblio.  If you are not comfortable with using the terminal, feel free to use the instructions above for a shared Linux host.

These procedures have been tested on Fedora 21 and Ubuntu 14.04.

=== Install prerequisite software

OpenBiblio requires apache, PHP, and MySQL.  If you intend to copy catalog records from other libraries, we strongly recommend that you use yaz.  The following steps include a YAZ install.

On Ubuntu 14.04:

[source,bash]
----
1. sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server yaz php5-dev php5-mysql php-pear libyaz4-dev unzip
2. use your favorite editor to add "extension=yaz.so" to /etc/php/apache/php.ini 
   TIP: search for 'extension=' to find the right location
3. sudo pecl install yaz
----

TIP: This will prompt you to choose a root password for MySQL.  Make sure it is a secure one!


On Fedora 21:

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install httpd php mysql-server php-devel php-mysql php-pear unzip yaz libyaz-devel gcc
sudo mysql_secure_installation
----

TIP: mysql_secure_installation will ask you for a current root password, which you may leave blank.  Be sure to give root a new, secure password.  You should also choose to remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, and remove the test database.

=== Install yaz (optional)

Next, install yaz as a PHP extension using pecl.

[source,bash]
----
sudo pecl install yaz
----

Add a new line to your php.ini file.  This file can be found at /etc/php/php.ini
in Fedora and /etc/php5/apache/php/ini in Ubuntu.  The line should be something
like the following:

[source,perl]
----
extension=yaz.so
----

=== Start the Apache and MySQL services

On Fedora 21:

[source,bash]
----
sudo service httpd start
sudo service mysqld start
----

On Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo service apache2 start
sudo service mysql start
----

=== Create a MySQL database

First, open up MySQL.

[source,bash]
----
mysql -uroot -p #MySQL will ask you for the root password you just created
----

Next, type the following commands to create a user and database for
OpenBiblio to use.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE obiblio;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON obiblio.* TO obib_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'obib_password';
----

=== Prepare OpenBiblio for its installation

[source,bash]
----
wget -O obib.zip https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-1.0-wip/get/26f88507b580.zip
unzip obib.zip
----

Delete the default "It Works" page from /var/www/html.

[source,bash]
----
sudo mv ./* /var/www/html/
----

On Fedora 21, you may need to run the following command to configure SeLinux to
allow access to the folder.

[source,bash]
----
restorecon -r /var/www/html
----
