== Installing OpenBiblio 1.0 on a Linux host with full access

These instructions consist mainly of commands that you can run in your terminal to quickly get a working installation of OpenBiblio.  If you are not comfortable with using the terminal, feel free to use the instructions above for a shared Linux host.

These procedures have been tested on Fedora 21.

=== Install prerequisite software

On Fedora 21:

[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install httpd php mysql-server php-devel php-mysql php-pear unzip yaz libyaz-devel gcc
sudo pecl install yaz
# Add a new lie extension=yaz.so to the file /etc/php/php.ini
sudo service httpd start
sudo service mysqld start
sudo mysql_secure_installation
----

This program will ask you for a current root password, which you may leave blank.  Be sure to give root a new, secure password.  You should also choose to remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, and remove the test database.

[source,bash]
----
mysql -uroot -p #MySQL will ask you for the root password you just created
CREATE DATABASE obiblio;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON obiblio.* TO obib_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'obib_password';
CTRL + D # pressing these keys together will return you to the typical shell prompt
wget https://bitbucket.org/mstetson/obiblio-1.0-wip/get/26f88507b580.zip
unzip 26f88507b580.zip
cp # copy the db constants file
sudo mv mstetson/* /var/www/html
restorecon -r /var/www/html
----

On Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
echo
