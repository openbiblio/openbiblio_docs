== Translation Utilities (transUtils)

This plugin is intended as an aid to the creation or maintenance of a locale translation.
All T('...') entries in OB .php files are checked.
Each available translation is tested seperately.

The following functions are available:

. Check for Duplicate Entries. Intended to find duplicate entries which may be out of place alphebetically and so un-noticed.
. Check for Unused Entries. Look for table entries which have been abandoned, or through miss-spelling somewhere, are not currently being used.
. Check for Needed Entries. Look for T('...') entries which do not have a corresponding entry in the trans.php file.
. Check for Potential Entries. Look for quoted strings (both normal display, and error) in all files which do not have a T('...') surround. 
Error messages embedded in the various language processors (PHP, JS, CSS, mySQL, etc) will not be caught.
