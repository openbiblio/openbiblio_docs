== Skipping navigation menus

If you are using OpenBiblio with screenreader software, you may not be interested in listening to your software
recite all of OpenBiblio's navigation links every time you move to a new page.  You can instead select the
link called "Skip to main content," which will take you to the content that you are more interested, such as
the catalog or circulation interface.

You may also access this link using your keyboard using Tab key repeatedly.
