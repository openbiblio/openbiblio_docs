OpenBiblio Recipes
==================

This is a collection of neat tricks and configurations that might be nice for your library.

== Adding a link to your system documentation

You can configure the "Help" link in OpenBiblio's menu to link to any URL you would like.
This defaults to the official OpenBiblio documentation, but you may wish to replace it with
some help that is customized for users at your library.

NOTE: You will need access to the SQL database to do this; it has not yet been added to the
end-user interface.

. Open up the SQL database using the interface of your choice (be it PhpMyAdmin, a command-line
interface, or any other tool you prefer).
. Type `UPDATE settings SET value='https://myLibraryDocs.example.com' WHERE name='help_link'`
(using your own URL instead of `https://myLibraryDocs.example.com`).
. Refresh the OpenBiblio interface in your browser.  When you click on the help link, it should
pop up a new window with your custom documentation.

== Changing the timeout length on HMAC requests

OpenBiblio encrypts certain requests that might expose confidential member data.  Every time a
user opens or refreshes a *Forms.php page that might expose such data, the clock starts ticking
and they must make their requests before a certain number of minutes elapse.  This is to make
sure that if the request falls into the wrong hands, the intruder will not have access to these
data for very long.

You can set the number of minutes before sensitive requests time out to the value that works best
for your library, based on factors like your workflow and security concerns.

. Open up the SQL database using the interface of your choice (be it PhpMyAdmin, a command-line
interface, or any other tool you prefer).
. Type `UPDATE settings SET value='5' WHERE name='hmac_timeout'`
where 5 is the number of minutes before sensitive requests become invalid.

TIP: If you would like to "turn off" this timeout feature (technically setting the expire time to
28 days), set the value to 0.
