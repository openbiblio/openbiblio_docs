==================

This is a collection of neat tricks and configurations that might be nice for your library.

== Adding a link to your system documentation

You can configure the "Help" link in OpenBiblio's menu to link to any URL you would like.
This defaults to the official OpenBiblio documentation, but you may wish to replace it with
some help that is customized for users at your library.

NOTE: You will need access to the SQL database to do this; it has not yet been added to the
end-user interface.

. Open up the SQL database using the interface of your choice (be it PhpMyAdmin, a command-line
interface, or any other tool you prefer).
. Type `UPDATE settings SET value='https://myLibraryDocs.example.com' WHERE name='help_link'`
(using your own URL instead of `https://myLibraryDocs.example.com`).
. Refresh the OpenBiblio interface in your browser.  When you click on the help link, it should
pop up a new window with your custom documentation.
