== Managing your users

To add a new staff member, go to Admin -> Staff Admin.  Click on the "Add New" button,
found both at the top and bottom of this screen.  You can then assign a username, password,
name, and permission set to your staff member.

WARNING: You must assign at least one permission, or the staff member will not be able to log in.

=== Working with passwords

Openbiblio's password management system is very straightforward.  Users with 
Admin permission are able to change their own password or the password of any 
other staff account (including other administrators).  Users without the Admin
permission may not change anybody's password, not even their own.

To change the password of a staff account, go to Admin -> Staff Admin. Click
the pwd button next to the account you are working with.  Enter the new
password.
