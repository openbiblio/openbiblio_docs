== Managing your users

To add a new staff member, go to Admin -> Staff Admin.  Click on the "Add New" button,
found both at the top and bottom of this screen.  You can then assign a username, password,
name, and permission set to your staff member.

WARNING: You must assign at least one permission, or the staff member will not be able to log in.
