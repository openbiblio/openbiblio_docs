== Managing your libraries

OpenBiblio 1.0 introduced the ability to manage multiple libraries
with a single OpenBiblio installation.  Each library is considered
a separate "site," with its own name, collection, address, hours, 
closed dates, and other settings.

=== Adding a site

. Go to Admin -> Sites.
. Click "Add New".
. Fill out the relevant information. Choose the calendar that includes
the dates your new library will be closed.  See below for more information
about the calendars.
+
WARNING: If you do not choose a calendar, the new site will not be able
to calculate due dates properly and you will not be able to check out
any copies at this site.
+
. Click "Add."

=== Deleting a site

. Ensure that there are no copies at the site that you'd like to delete.
. Sign in as a different site.
. Go to Admin -> Sites.
. Delete the site.

NOTE: OpenBiblio does not allow you to delete the site that you are
currently signed in as.

NOTE: OpenBiblio checks to make sure that there are no copies attached
to the site you wish to delete.  If there are still copies attached, you
will have to delete them or move them to a different site before you can
delete the site.
