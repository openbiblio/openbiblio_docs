== Managing your catalog

This section describes settings in the Admin menu related to
cataloging.

=== Managing media types

You can access media types in Admin -> Media Types.

There are several settings you can choose for any Media
Type in your catalog, which are listed below.

. _Description_ - a human-readable name for what type of
material you are describing.
. _Checkout Limit_ - the maximum number of this type of
item a member may check out.
. _Default_ - If this is set to _Y_, the cataloging module
will default to the current media type.
+
NOTE: You should be careful to only set one media type to
be default, or else the cataloging module will run into
errors
+
. _Search display lines_ - This setting governs how long
search results views will be.  If you choose 5, for example,
the search results page will display the first 5 MARC
fields for items of this media type (based on the order
you define in the Admin -> Biblio fields interface).
. _Image file_ - You may upload your own icon image for
this media type here.

=== Managing displayed fields

Each type of media displays certain MARC fields, and can be
labeled in specific ways.  For example, the field `300$a`
contains page numbers for book records and number of discs
for DVDs.  Therefore, you might want to label these in
different ways to create the clearest experience for your
members and staff.

==== Adding and re-arranging displayed fields

. Go to Admin -> Media Types. Make sure that you have the
appropriate media types listed.
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click "Add to / Modify Layout".
. To add new fields, use the dropdown menus in
the right column to choose the field that you would
like. You may include the same field multiple times
if you wish.
. To re-arrange fields, drag and drop the entries in
the right column until you are satisfied.
. When everything looks good, click "Save Layout".

==== Removing and renaming displayed fields
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click the "Edit" button next to the field
you wish to remove or rename.
