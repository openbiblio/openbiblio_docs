=== Managing displayed fields

Each type of media displays certain MARC fields, and can be
labeled in specific ways.  For example, the field `300$a`
contains page numbers for book records and number of discs
for DVDs.  Therefore, you might want to label these in
different ways to create the clearest experience for your
members and staff.

appropriate media types listed.
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.

. To add new fields, use the dropdown menus in
the right column to choose the field that you would

the right column until you are satisfied.
. When everything looks good, click "Save Layout".
