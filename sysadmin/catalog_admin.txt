== Managing your catalog

This section describes settings in the Admin menu related to
cataloging.

=== Managing media types

You can access media types in Admin -> Media Types.

There are several settings you can choose for any Media
Type in your catalog, which are listed below.

* _Description_ - a human-readable name for what type of
material you are describing.
* _Checkout Limit_ - the maximum number of this type of
item a member may check out.
* _Default_ - If this is set to _Y_, the cataloging module
will default to the current media type.
+
NOTE: You should be careful to only set one media type to
be default, or else the cataloging module will run into
errors
+
* _Search display lines_ - This setting governs how long
search results views will be.  If you choose 5, for example,
the search results page will display the first 5 MARC
fields for items of this media type (based on the order
you define in the Admin -> Biblio fields interface).
* _Image file_ - You may upload your own icon image for
this media type here.



=== Managing collections

You can access media types in Admin -> Collections.

There are several settings you can choose for any 
Collection in your catalog, which are listed below.

* _Description_ - a human-readable name for your
collection, such as "Fiction," "Children's books,"
or "Genealogy Room."  We recommend that each
collection correspond to a physical area in your
library.
* _Item count_ - this field is calculated automatically
by OpenBiblio based on how many items exist in this
collection.
* _Collection type_ - this field allows you to decide
whether items in this collection should circulate or
be distributed.
* _Default_ - If this is set to _Y_, the cataloging module
will default to the current collection.

NOTE: You should be careful to only set one collection to
be default, or else the cataloging module will run into
errors.

==== Circulating collections

Circulating collections have a number of other settings,
usually associated with a specific _due date calculator._

* _Due date calculator_ is a specific procedure to determine
when items in your collection should be due back to the library.
** _simple_: this due date calculator will simply add the
requested number of days and minutes to the current date and time.
If the library's calendar indicates that the library will be closed
on that day, it will extend the due date to 11:59 p.m. on the
next available open day.
** _at midnight_: this calculator works very similarly to the _simple_
calculator, except that it _always_ extends due dates to 11:59 p.m.
This calculator functions very similarly to the circulation module
in OpenBiblio 0.7.x, and is the best choice for collections that
you'd like to circulate for a certain number of days.
** _before we close_: this calculator is for items that should return
to the library at closing time.  Items will be due after the specified
number of minutes or at closing time, whichever comes first. If you
specify the Pre-closing padding, items will be due the specified number
of minutes before the library closes, so that members don't try to
return the items as you are trying to close the library.
** _ask me_: anytime an item in this collection circulates, the staff
member will manually select the due date and time.  This can be useful
for interlibrary loan collections, where due dates are rarely standardized.
* _Days due back_ - the length of the loan period in days for items
from this collection.
* _Minutes due back_ - the length of the loan period in minutes for items
from this collection. You may combine this with the _days due back_ field,
if you would like (e.g. items can be checked out for 3 days and 45 minutes).
* _Daily late fee_ - The overdue fee for each day an item is held
overdue.
* _Important date_ - a specific date that OpenBiblio should take into account
when calculating a due date and time.  This might be the end of a term at school.
* _Important date purpose_ - what OpenBiblio should due with the important date.
** _ceiling date_ - OpenBiblio will not calculate any dates that fall after the
important date.
** _specific date_ - OpenBiblio will always use the important date as the due
date.



=== Managing displayed fields

Each type of media displays certain MARC fields, and can be
labeled in specific ways.  For example, the field `300$a`
contains page numbers for book records and number of discs
for DVDs.  Therefore, you might want to label these in
different ways to create the clearest experience for your
members and staff.

==== Adding and re-arranging displayed fields

. Go to Admin -> Media Types. Make sure that you have the
appropriate media types listed.
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click "Add to / Modify Layout".
. To add new fields, use the dropdown menus in
the right column to choose the field that you would
like. You may include the same field multiple times
if you wish.
. To re-arrange fields, drag and drop the entries in
the right column until you are satisfied.
. When everything looks good, click "Save Layout".

==== Removing and renaming displayed fields
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click the "Edit" button next to the field
you wish to remove or rename.
. Here you can change the "label" that displays
to members and staff, as well as data standards
for this field.

=== Managing custom fields for copies

OpenBiblio offers some great flexibility for
describing your physical items.  In fact, you
can add any field you'd like by going to Admin
-> Biblio Copy Fields.

Any fields you enter here will be displayed to
your staff members as optional fields.

=== Managing copy catalog options

OpenBiblio's lookup feature saves catalogers
a lot of time and hassle by importing
pre-existing biblio records from other libraries
using the SRU or z39.50 protocols.

You must complete these configurations before using
the lookup features.

==== Basic configuration

To access these options, go to Admin ->
Online Options.

. _Online protocol:_  If you have installed yaz
correctly, we recommend that you select YAZ from
this menu.  This will use the z39.50 protocol,
which is more widely used than the SRU protocol.
. _Maximum hits:_ the number of hits to display to catalogers.
. _Timeout:_ the amount of time
OpenBiblio should wait for a response from the
lookup host.
. _Keep dashes:_ This setting determines whether or not you
would like to keep hyphen characters in ISBNs
that your catalogers enter. We recommend that
you set this to false, because most z39.50 and
SRU servers index ISBNs without hyphens.
. _Call number type:_ the call number
scheme that you'd like to use.  OpenBiblio
will then attempt to retrieve a call number
of that type from the remote server to add
to a 099 field.
. Not sure what Auto Dewey does
. _Default Dewey_ provides a default call number
for items you catalog using the Dewey Decimal
Classification, in case the remote server does
not provide useful Dewey Call Number information.
. _Auto Cutter_ will automatically generate a
Cutter number for you.
. _Cutter Type_ asks you to choose between LoC cutters
and Cutter-Sanborn cutters.
. _Noise words_ are common words that you would like
to remove from your queries to get better results.
. _Auto collection_ will automatically put new copies
in your default collection.
. _Fiction name_ will be the initial part of any call
number for fiction books, which typically do not use
formal call numbers.

==== Server-by-server configuration

You will also need to configure each remote server
in Admin -> Online Hosts.
