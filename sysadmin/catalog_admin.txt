== Managing your catalog

This section describes settings in the Admin menu related to
cataloging.

=== Managing media types

You can access media types in Admin -> Media Types.

There are several settings you can choose for any Media
Type in your catalog, which are listed below.

. _Description_ - a human-readable name for what type of
material you are describing.
. _Checkout Limit_ - the maximum number of this type of
item a member may check out.
. _Default_ - If this is set to _Y_, the cataloging module
will default to the current media type.
+
NOTE: You should be careful to only set one media type to
be default, or else the cataloging module will run into
errors
+
. _Search display lines_ - This setting governs how long
search results views will be.  If you choose 5, for example,
the search results page will display the first 5 MARC
fields for items of this media type (based on the order
you define in the Admin -> Biblio fields interface).
. _Image file_ - You may upload your own icon image for
this media type here.



=== Managing collections

You can access media types in Admin -> Collections.

There are several settings you can choose for any 
Collection in your catalog, which are listed below.

. _Description_ - a human-readable name for your
collection, such as "Fiction," "Children's books,"
or "Genealogy Room."  We recommend that each
collection correspond to a physical area in your
library.
. _Item count_ - this field is calculated automatically
by OpenBiblio based on how many items exist in this
collection.
. _Collection type_ - this field allows you to decide
whether items in this collection should circulate or
be distributed.
. _Default_ - If this is set to _Y_, the cataloging module
will default to the current collection.
+
NOTE: You should be careful to only set one collection to
be default, or else the cataloging module will run into
errors.
+
. _Days due back_ - the length of the loan period in days for items
from this collection.  You may set this to 0 if you would
not like items to circulate.
. _Daily late fee_ - The overdue fee for each day an item is held
overdue.




=== Managing displayed fields

Each type of media displays certain MARC fields, and can be
labeled in specific ways.  For example, the field `300$a`
contains page numbers for book records and number of discs
for DVDs.  Therefore, you might want to label these in
different ways to create the clearest experience for your
members and staff.

==== Adding and re-arranging displayed fields

. Go to Admin -> Media Types. Make sure that you have the
appropriate media types listed.
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click "Add to / Modify Layout".
. To add new fields, use the dropdown menus in
the right column to choose the field that you would
like. You may include the same field multiple times
if you wish.
. To re-arrange fields, drag and drop the entries in
the right column until you are satisfied.
. When everything looks good, click "Save Layout".

==== Removing and renaming displayed fields
. Go to Admin -> Biblio fields.
. Choose the media type you are interested in.
. Click the "Edit" button next to the field
you wish to remove or rename.
. Here you can change the "label" that displays
to members and staff, as well as data standards
for this field.

=== Managing custom fields for copies

OpenBiblio offers some great flexibility for
describing your physical items.  In fact, you
can add any field you'd like by going to Admin
-> Biblio Copy Fields.

Any fields you enter here will be displayed to
your staff members as optional fields.

=== Managing copy catalog options

OpenBiblio's lookup feature saves catalogers
a lot of time and hassle by importing
pre-existing biblio records from other libraries
using the SRU or z39.50 protocols.

==== Initial setup

. Go to Admin -> Online Options.
. Choose the protocol.  If you have installed yaz
correctly, we recommend that you select YAZ from
this menu.  This will use the z39.50 protocol,
which is more widely used than the SRU protocol.
. Choose the maximum number of hits to display.
. Choose the timeout variable: the amount of time
OpenBiblio should wait for a response from the
lookup host.
. In "keep dashes", choose whether or not you
would like to keep hyphen characters in ISBNs
that your catalogers enter.
